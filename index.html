      <h1>Kartik Joshi, a.k.a kabiir</h1>
      <p><em><strong>Data Science Enthusiast </strong> by the day, <strong> Traveller </strong>by the weekends, and <strong>Poet</strong> by soul.</em></p>
      <p>Hello. I'm Kartik. I am pursuing my dream of becoming a data scientist. I am enrolled in Electronics and Computer Engineering at Vellore Institute of Engineering. A pre-final year student, who absolutely loves data wrangling, looking forward for diving deep into the Research Domain pertaining to Deep Learning. Summer Research Internships will help me dive deep into Computer Vision and NLP (my primary interests). Having said that, I am also open to Remote Research Internship opportunities, it would be great to collaborate with research projects.</p>
      <br>Apart from Data Science, Poetry has my soul. I find solace in poetry, one of the reasons I was attracted to NLP. A part of me is also #Wanderlust, always ready for a new adventure, a new experience.
