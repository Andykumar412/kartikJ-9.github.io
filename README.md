Hello. I am Kartik. This repository contains files for my blog. I am planning to maintain a blog as a portfolio project. As an extension to this, I am thinking to create a customized platform for my poetries and travelling experiences. Visit kartikj-9.github.io for more information.

# Note:
I am new to the domain of web development, and I am on a path to learn full stack web development. Any suggestions for improving this blog are highly appreciated. Reach out to me via mail. kartik.joshi2017@vitstudent.ac.in
